## Project name: School Watch
Real-time monitoring of the emotional well-being of students at school (for example, bullying) and alerts to their parents if necessary.

## About
Using a 360-degree camera and facial and motion recognition, our solution monitors the emotional well-being of school-age students real-time and sends any critical alerts to their parents. All of the transactions are logged on a private blockchain for transparency and record-keeping.
